            The Hong Kong Trail is the third long-distance hiking trail in Hong Kong. It is located on Hong Kong Island
            and was opened in April 1985. The Hong Kong Trail is divided into eight sections with a total length of
            approximately 50km. It is the shortest long-distance hiking trail in Hong Kong. The route mainly runs from
            the Peak in the west of Hong Kong Island to Big Wave Bay near Shek O in the east.

            The starting point of the Hong Kong Trail is at the famous tourist spot - The Peak. The first section of the
            first route will follow the belly of Victoria Peak ("Cheer Flag Hill") and descend to the Pok Fu Lam
            Reservoir; the second and third sections will first pass through Belle Road, then go around the hillsides of
            Mount Kellett and Tin Wan Hill and then go to Wan Chai Gap; the last section will go around the belly of
            Cameron Peak about 240 meters high, pass through the middle gorge and go to Wong Nai Chung Gap. The first
            section of the Hong Kong Trail Section 5 overlaps with the first section of the Wilson Trail Section 2. This
            section climbs up the 400-meter-high Jardine's Lookout and Mount Beina, and then descends steeply to Tai
            Fung Au via steps. The next section goes down along the wide Mount Parker Road, and after appreciating the
            over 100-year-old Tai Tam Reservoir, you will reach Tai Tam Road. The seventh section is a relatively gentle
            route, mainly walking along the water channel, bypassing Shek Bei Shan to Tu Di Wan. The last section of the
            Hong Kong Trail runs along the world-famous hiking spot Dragon's Back, bypassing Pottinger Hill, and finally
            descends gently to the end point Big Wave Bay.

            Some sections of the Hong Kong Trail are waterways and roads, which are rather dull; but there are also many
            sections that are dirt paths under the shade of trees, making people feel like they are in a primeval
            forest. There are many branch trails and exit points on each section of this trail, but there are signs
            along the way. The Hong Kong Trail is a unique long-distance hiking trail that wanders through the
            countryside next to the bustling city, creating a sharp contrast.
