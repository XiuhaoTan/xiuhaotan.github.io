            Wilson Trail is a long-distance hiking trail in Hong Kong. It was opened in 1996. It is 78 kilometers long
            and divided into 10 sections. It is the second longest hiking trail in Hong Kong, second only to the
            MacLehose Trail. The trail winds from Stanley in the south of Hong Kong Island to Nam Chung in the northeast
            of the New Territories, crossing many mountains and ridges in Hong Kong, and passing through eight country
            parks in Hong Kong: Tai Tam Country Park, Tai Tam Country Park (Quarry Bay Extension), Ma On Shan Country
            Park, Lion Rock Country Park, Kam Shan Country Park, Shing Mun Country Park, Tai Mo Shan Country Park and
            Pat Sin Leng Country Park. The Wilson Trail was named in memory of the 27th Governor of Hong Kong, Sir
            Wilson, who loved Hong Kong's mountains and hiking activities.

            The first section of the ninth section goes down to the tranquil Hok Tau Reservoir, the second section
            climbs up Pingfeng Mountain and Huangling, and then walks through the rolling Pat Sin Leng Mountains;
            finally, walk along the ancient Hengqi Ancient Trail, and then descend to Nanchong to complete the entire
            Wilson Trail.

            The Wilson Trail runs from south to north, and together with the MacLehose Trail connecting east and west,
            it divides Hong Kong and Kowloon like a cross. The route passes through urban areas, rural areas, ponds and
            mountains, with diverse landscapes. However, the route is divided by Victoria Harbour and can only be
            accessed through public transportation, which lacks integrity. In addition, the directions of some routes
            are marked with paint, which is not clear enough, but this has improved in recent years.
